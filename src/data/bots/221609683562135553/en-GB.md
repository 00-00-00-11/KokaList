# FlandersBOT
## A bot for sharing your favourite references! 

A discord bot with commands surrounding The Simpsons, Futurama and Rick and Morty *with 24/7 uptime!.*

FlandersBOT provides commands for The Simpsons, Futurama and Rick and Morty quoting/searching/content. FlandersBOT uses Frinkiac, Morbotron and Master of All Science to provide commands for both random and searchable Simpsons, Futurama and Rick and Morty images/gifs with their appropriate quotes embedded.
This means that you're always just one message away from sharing your favourite moments!

## Add FlandersBOT to your Discord Server
To invite FlandersBOT to your own discord server and start using it now, click the invite button above!

## Usage
The bot commands can be executed using several different methods/prefixes, to minimise clashing with other discord bots. Any command can be prefixed with an @mention, ned or diddly/doodly when you really want to flaunt those Flanders-isms.

If you're not a fan of any of these prefixes, you can add a new prefix to your server using the setprefix command.

### Usage Examples:

@FlandersBOT#0680 info

ned info   

diddly info   

doodly info   

diddly-info    

doodly-info
