**[In-Dev]**

Hey there! I'm CyborgToast, a general-purpose Discord Bot. I love playing with my users and throwing rage inducing Exceptions at my owner.
I do a bit of everything. I also have some neat features it's rare seing (or I could even be the only one ;) ).

Feel free to suggest new features or report bugs via the `feedback` command or by joining the support server (whose invite you can find in the `support` command)

You can check my commands [here](https://cyborgtoast.tk)!

*PS: The invite link contains the permissions the bot will need at all times, so be sure it has those otherwise it will not function 100%.*
