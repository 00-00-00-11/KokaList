DiscordTel is a functioning telephone bot. It's the best telephone bot you will find on Discord, as our telephone feature beats Yggdrasil.

We even have advancedâ„¢ technologies such as random dial (`>rdial`, to receive random dials you need to `>dial *411` and set description), call transferring (`>transfer <another number>` during a call), and call holding (`>hold`).

It also supports realistic numbers and bills, and you can even [recharge your account using credits from other bots](https://discordtel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Payment/)! Wow!

You can type `>help` to view all the commands.
