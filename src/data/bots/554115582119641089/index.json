As the bot grows, there may be more filters you can choose from. When swiping, you can swipe left, right or skip. If you both swipe right on each other, you \"match\" and can strike up a conversation in DM.\r\n\r\nNOTE: We are not responsible for the conversations created after matching or for any unverified false information people submit.  Use at your own risk."
