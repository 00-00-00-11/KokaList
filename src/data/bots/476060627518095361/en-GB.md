DCHPCord attempts to implement networking protocols within Discord such as TCP and ARP, with UDP on the way.
Features: 
IP addresses. Every user gets one! Guilds get different subnets, with external IP routing coming soon!
MAC addresses: every user and bot has a MAC address, just in case you suspect someoneâ€™s identity.
Sockets: create services like web servers and chat channels (chat channels soon).
Networking themed mod commands: kick, ban and mute using IP, MAC, or good old user ID

Note: help menu is ancient, will update SoonTM
