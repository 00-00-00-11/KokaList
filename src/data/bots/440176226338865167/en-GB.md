## **Commands**


There are a total of **189** commands. Showing them all here would too much. So... They can all be [viewed here](https://soheab.github.io/commands) in a very clean view! or a easy way is doing **s!help** in your server. **Extra:** All my commands and prefix are case insensitive
so you can use a command in any way like the about command you can send: *S!aBOuT* and it will work!

## **Key features**


1. My invite only includes the permissions the bot **really** needs, please don't give it any extra perms! 
and especially not **admin** don't give that dangerous perm to any bot! even if you trust it. You can trust 
this bot me as owner am aware of anything that a bot can do or can happen to a server so pls dont give any bot 
admin perms... anways.. you can really trust this bot i'm not one of those kids that wants attention with raiding 
and fake shit with a bot from a yt tutorial.

- Case insensitive everything, commands and prefix so 100% mobile friendly.
- Every command is tested and selfmade so that it works is guaranteed. If a command doesn't, please report it and you can slap me.
- Abuse resistant, every command has the name of the author in it. And all commands have a cooldown of 5+ secs.
- Improves everyday! just see s!changelog.
- Many useless things but also things you do not often see in a bot.
- Friendly embeds, i love to put more info in less space but still let it look good. So you won't expect big spammy embed from this bot.
