Looking for a well-rounded bot that can do almost anything? Cat may be able to fulfill your needs.

Some of the features included:

* High-quality audio player with a custom playlist system (YouTube, SoundCloud, Spotify, Twitch, Shoutcast/Icy/http streams, Mixer, Vimeo, Bandcamp...)
* Level based system with user-customizable profile cards, also has level-based role application and removal
* RPG-style Adventure game
* Casino games with a global economy system
* Mod tools
* Starboard
* Custom image-based welcome messages for new members
* A watching system for your server that reports when anything changes (server joins, leaves, role changes, message deletions or edits)
* Reaction-based raffle/giveaway
* NSFW image commands
* and much more as new commands are added frequently...

Cat is based on Red-DiscordBot's new rewrite. I welcome feedback as I am the dev for the audio module. Requests for new features are also welcomed (but will take a back seat to new audio improvements being written first).

Cat will never cost money to use and will have as close to a 100% uptime as possible.

Use c!help to get started once you've invited him. You can also set your own prefix for the bot with the c!set serverprefix command.
